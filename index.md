<br><b>Data Science Manager, SFL Scientific, a Deloitte business --- seen here after business hours at Kiholo Bay, Island of Hawai'i</b>

<br> Hi! I am a data scientist at SFL Scientific/ Deloitte US Consulting. I use machine learning and data science to solve both business and research problems in the energy, resources and industrial products sectors.

Prior to joining industry, I was a graduate research assistant at Vanderbilt University with Prof Benoit Dawant and Prof Jack Noble. I conducted research on medical image processing algorithms and statistical modeling to identify causes of poor health outcomes after surgery.
